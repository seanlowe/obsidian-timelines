# Timelines (Revamped)

Generate a chronological timeline in which all "events" are notes that include a specific tag or set of tags.

See the changelog from the last major update to view any breaking changes [here](./changelog.md#v200).

Documentation has moved!

I've written a brand new GitHub Pages docs site for **Timelines (Revamped)** at [https://seanlowe.github.io/obsidian-timelines](https://seanlowe.github.io/obsidian-timelines). Go check it out! If there are any problems, don't hesitate to create a new issue and point it out. Thanks!

## Release Notes

### v2.1.14

Added support for time spanning events in vertical timelines

**Changes**:
- overhauled `buildVerticalTimeline()`
- overhauled `vertical-timeline.scss`
- changed `endDate` to default to the same as start date rather than null
- added `DOM.Iterable` to `tsconfig.json`

See the [changelog](./changelog.md) for more details on previous releases.
