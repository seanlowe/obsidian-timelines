## Release Notes

### v2.3.2

Bug Fix for: `[Bug - Vertical] Sections of the date are visible when not provided` [#86](https://github.com/seanlowe/obsidian-timelines/issues/86)

**Changes:**
- revamped the date functionality so that users can pass date string sections as 0 or choose not pass them at all to keep them from rendering on the timeline
- removed some unnecessary functions and types in cleanup
- updated the docs on HTML event arguments to portray the new functionality

See the [changelog](./changelog.md) for more details on previous releases.
